# MiniTutorialCPP
1. Propose of this tutorial: This project is intended to describe general programming concepts in C++, along with concrete, functional code examples. 
It could be used as a refresher, or as a thorough tutorial of C++.
2. Disclaimer: The contents lean heavily on the book "C++ Primer Plus 6.ed" by Stephen Prata. The code snippets are modified so that as many concepts as possible could be explained within less text. 

## The structure of the project and some ideas
1. Basic concepts of Object-Oriented-Programming/Generic-Programming/etc are illustrated in a common markdown file: concept_list.md .
2. C++ header files are in the folder {project_root}/include/
3. C++ implementation files are in the folder {project_root}/src/
4. When a new concept is first imported in the file concept_list.md, the corresponding code should also be added immediately. 
5. The concept description and the code should be linked somehow.
