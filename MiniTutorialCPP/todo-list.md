**interface in Page 509**: An interface is a shared framework for interactions between two systems. For classes, we speak of **public interface**. In this case, the public is the program using the class, the interacting system consists of the class objects, and the interface consists of the methods provided by whoever wrote the class. The interface enables you, the programmer, to write code that interacts with class objects, and thus it enables the program to use the class objects. It turns out that the classs design denies direct access to the public user.
